        - [ ] Implement relationship selectors/helpers
        - [ ] Refactor all logic and UI to use new model
        - [ ] Update validation and test
- [ ] Add confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
- [ ] Enhance error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Test all edge cases from PRD Section 6

#### 1.9 Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Comprehensive testing checklist implementation
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness testing
- [ ] Performance optimization for large trees
- [ ] Accessibility testing (screen readers, keyboard navigation)

### ‚ùå Remaining Tasks

#### 1.10 Final Polish
- [ ] Complete Arabic RTL interface implementation
- [ ] Optimize tree rendering performance
- [ ] Add loading states and error boundaries
