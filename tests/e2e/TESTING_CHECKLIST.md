## Test Execution

### Manual Testing
1. Go through each checklist item manually
2. Document any issues found
3. Test on different devices and browsers
4. Test with different data scenarios

### Automated Testing
1. Run Playwright E2E tests: `npm run test:e2e`
2. Run specific test suites: `npm run test:e2e -- --grep "Member Management"`
3. Run tests on specific browsers: `npm run test:e2e -- --project=chromium`

### Performance Testing

2. Test with large datasets
3. Monitor memory usage
4. Check bundle size

### Accessibility Testing
1. Use screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver)
2. Test keyboard-only navigation
3. Use accessibility audit tools
4. Check color contrast ratios
